### ⚠️ Important

These resources are **supplements**, not substitutes.

They are designed to **consolidate and extend what you’ve already read in the book**.  
The structure, context, explanations, and real-world guidance live in the chapters themselves.

If you jump straight into the resources without reading the chapter, you’ll miss the “why” behind them.
