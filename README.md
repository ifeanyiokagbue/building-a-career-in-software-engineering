# Building a Career in Software Engineering  
### A Roadmap from Trainee to Engineering Manager

Unlock the secrets to a **thriving, sustainable career in software engineering**.

Many people enter tech with big dreams but little clarity. They learn to code, apply endlessly, struggle to grow, or get stuck wondering *“what next?”*  
**Building a Career in Software Engineering** is designed to fix that.

This book provides a clear, experience-backed roadmap for navigating every stage of a software engineering career — from trainee and junior roles to senior positions and engineering management. It focuses on **real-world growth**, not theory, hype, or shortcuts.

## Why This Book Exists

This book is built on **over a decade of hands-on industry experience** as a software engineer, mentor, and engineering manager.

It helps you:

- Make smarter career decisions at each stage
- Avoid common mistakes that slow down or derail growth
- Prepare intentionally for leadership, not accidentally stumble into it

This is not about “learning one language and getting rich.”  
It’s about **building a career that lasts**.

## Why I Wrote This Book

I wrote this book to document the lessons that are rarely taught but deeply felt in real software engineering careers.

I’ve experienced:
- Early confusion and career uncertainty
- Interview failures and hard lessons
- Growth from junior roles into leadership
- Mentoring engineers through similar struggles

This book is the guidance I wish I had earlier — practical, honest, and grounded in reality.
